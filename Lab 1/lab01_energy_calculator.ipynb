    "### Step 1: Prepare Your Data\n",

    "- building_name: Name of the building\n",
    "- monthly_consumption: Monthly energy consumption (kWh)\n",
    "- floor_area: Floor area in square meters (m²)\n",
    "- peak_percentage: (Optional) Peak usage percentage (0-1), defaults to 0.6\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Process Your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For files with < 50,000 buildings:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = process_buildings_from_file(\"your_buildings.csv\")\n",
    "df_processed = calculate_energy_metrics(df)\n",
    "summary = generate_summary_report(df_processed)\n",

    "### Step 3: Export Results\n",
    "The system automatically exports to multiple formats:\n",
    "- CSV: Detailed results for all buildings\n",
    "- Excel: Multi-sheet workbook with analysis\n",
    "- TXT: Summary report\n",
    "- Efficiency CSV: Quick reference for ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features for Scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Batch Processing: Handles thousands of buildings efficiently  \n",
    "✅ Progress Tracking: Visual progress bars for large datasets  \n",
    "✅ Memory Optimization: Chunked processing prevents memory issues  \n",
    "✅ Data Validation: Automatically cleans and validates input data  \n",
    "✅ Multiple Export Formats: CSV, Excel, and text reports  \n",
    "✅ Error Handling: Robust error handling for large datasets  \n",
    "✅ Performance Monitoring: Tracks processing time and memory usage  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Expectations:\n",
    "- 1,000 buildings: ~2-3 seconds\n",
    "- 10,000 buildings: ~15-30 seconds  \n",
    "- 100,000 buildings: ~2-5 minutes (with chunked processing)\n",
